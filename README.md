# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section solution

This is a solution to the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

Okay, again, I'm terrible at explaining things, so please forgive me.

I'm coding with simple HTML and CSS, without Sass or anything like that. I'm having less difficulty with grids this time, and I think this project is very similar to the one from Frontend Mentor, so I'm happy.

I read articles from MDN and Web Dev, which helped me a lot. I dove headfirst into this—grids—reading and programming, without tutorials, just reading and practicing.

That's it.
